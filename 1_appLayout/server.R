## Source global.R file
## This file must be in the same directory as your ui.R and server.R files
source('global.R')

# Note: library calls can be saved in the global file and the app still runs
#  and it looks cleaner.


## Server processing
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  # Nothing in here to start
})
